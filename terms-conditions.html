      <p class="text-justify">
        Welcome to Xartum. By accessing or using our digital platforms, applications, or services, you agree to be bound
        by the terms outlined below. These Terms & Conditions establish the legal framework that governs the
        relationship
        between you as a client or visitor and Xartum as a provider of premium real estate services. They are designed
        to
        protect both your interests and ours, ensuring fairness, transparency, and mutual accountability. If you do not
        accept these terms in full, please discontinue use of our services immediately.
      </p>

      <h4 class="mt-4">1. Acceptance of Terms</h4>
      <p class="text-justify">
        By using our website or services, you confirm that you are at least 18 years of age (or the age of majority in
        your jurisdiction) and legally competent to enter into binding contracts. Your continued use of Xartum
        constitutes
        your ongoing acceptance of this agreement. Acceptance extends not only to the Terms stated here but also to our
        Privacy Policy and any supplemental guidelines or conditions specific to certain services we provide. If you are
        acting on behalf of a company or organization, you warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to
        this
        agreement.
      </p>

      <h4 class="mt-4">2. Ownership & Intellectual Property</h4>
      <p class="text-justify">
        All content, designs, code, graphics, logos, service marks, images, and proprietary software found on this
        platform
        are the exclusive property of Xartum or its licensors, protected under U.S. and international intellectual
        property laws. Unauthorized use, reproduction, or distribution of any such materials is strictly prohibited. You
        are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and use the website solely for personal
        and non-commercial purposes. You may not modify, copy, republish, upload, or distribute any content from our
        site
        without prior written consent. Any unauthorized use may result in legal action, including claims for damages or
        injunctive relief.
      </p>

      <h4 class="mt-4">3. Limitation of Liability</h4>
      <p class="text-justify">
        To the fullest extent permitted by U.S. law, Xartum shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
        or
        consequential damages arising out of or in connection with your access to or use of the site, including but not
        limited to loss of data, revenue, or profits. While we strive to ensure accuracy of information presented on our
        platform, we make no warranties, expressed or implied, regarding the completeness, reliability, or availability
        of
        content, services, or third-party links. You agree that any reliance on such information is at your own risk.
        Furthermore, Xartum does not guarantee uninterrupted service or freedom from errors, viruses, or other harmful
        components. Your sole remedy for dissatisfaction with the platform is to discontinue use.
      </p>

      <h4 class="mt-4">4. User Conduct & Responsibilities</h4>
      <p class="text-justify">
        You agree not to misuse our platform, including but not limited to engaging in unlawful, harmful, threatening,
        abusive, harassing, defamatory, or disruptive behavior. You further agree not to interfere with the security,
        functionality, or integrity of our systems or the experience of other users. This includes refraining from
        attempts
        to hack, introduce malicious code, or scrape data without authorization. Any misuse of our services may result
        in
        suspension or permanent termination of your access, as well as potential civil and criminal liability. Users are
        expected to act with respect, integrity, and professionalism in all interactions with Xartum, our partners, and
        other clients.
      </p>

      <h4 class="mt-4">5. U.S. Jurisdiction & Governing Law</h4>
      <p class="text-justify">
        This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
        regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Any legal action or proceeding arising out of or related to these
        Terms
        shall be brought exclusively in a federal or state court located in Delaware. By accepting these Terms, you
        expressly consent to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts. If any provision of this Agreement is found to
        be
        invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect, ensuring continuity of
        obligations. This governing law clause underscores our commitment to maintaining a clear, consistent legal
        framework for all clients and partners.
      </p>

      <h4 class="mt-4">6. Modifications to Terms</h4>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Xartum reserves the right to update, revise, or replace these Terms at any time without prior notice. Such
        modifications may reflect changes in legal requirements, industry practices, or our evolving business model.
        Updated terms will be posted on this page, with the “last updated” date reflecting the most recent revision.
        Continued use of our platform following the publication of changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised
        agreement. It is your responsibility to review this page periodically to stay informed of updates. Failure to do
        so
        does not exempt you from compliance with any modified terms.
      </p>

      <h4 class="mt-4">7. Indemnification</h4>
      <p class="text-justify">
        You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Xartum, its affiliates, employees, and partners from and
        against
        any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, or expenses (including legal fees) arising from your violation of these
        Terms, misuse of our services, or infringement of any third-party rights. This obligation will survive
        termination
        of your use of our platform. By agreeing to indemnify, you acknowledge responsibility for your actions and any
        consequences resulting from them.
      </p>

      <h4 class="mt-4">8. Third-Party Links & Services</h4>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Our platform may include links to external websites or third-party services for your convenience. Xartum is not
        responsible for the content, accuracy, or policies of these third-party sites. Accessing them is at your own
        risk,
        and we encourage you to review their respective terms and privacy policies. Inclusion of third-party links does
        not
        imply endorsement or partnership unless expressly stated. We disclaim all liability for any issues arising from
        your engagement with external sites or service providers.
      </p>

      <h4 class="mt-4">9. Termination of Access</h4>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Xartum reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to suspend or terminate your access to the platform at any
        time,
        without notice, for conduct that violates these Terms or is otherwise deemed harmful to the platform, our
        clients,
        or our reputation. Upon termination, your right to use the services will cease immediately, but provisions
        concerning intellectual property, limitation of liability, indemnification, and governing law shall survive and
        remain enforceable.
      </p>

      <h4 class="mt-4">10. Contact</h4>
      <p class="text-justify">
        For questions regarding this User Agreement, please contact us at
        <a href="mailto:office@xartum.ch" class="text-warning fw-semibold">office@xartum.ch</a> . We are committed to
